Foojay.io quietly moved off WordPress and onto Hugo, a static site generator. No more CMS login, no database, no admin panel — just Markdown and AsciiDoc files, built and deployed straight from GitHub. In this episode we dig into why that move happened, and into the bigger question behind it: is a traditional CMS still the right way to run a content site in 2026, or has static tooling caught up? Along the way we go through the real security numbers behind WordPress's plugin ecosystem — more than 10,000 vulnerabilities found in WordPress plugins since 2025 alone — and put very different static site generators head to head: Hugo and Jekyll, the veterans, versus Roq, the Java-and-Quarkus-based newcomer.

To help unpack it, I'm joined by two guests from the Quarkus team. Andy Damevin built `code.quarkus.io` and created Roq, Quarkus's own static site framework; Holly Cummins led the migration of quarkus.io itself from Jekyll to Roq. Between them they've lived both sides of the "why does my static site generator feel like this" question.

We cover what actually breaks on a WordPress site (it's almost never WordPress core — it's the plugins you need to do anything with it), what "recovery" means when your content lives in Git instead of a database, how to extend Roq as a Java developer, what migrating from WordPress to Roq (or Hugo) actually looks like in practice, and where a CMS still earns its keep despite all of this.
