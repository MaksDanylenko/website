I have written Java in many editors and IDEs over the years, and they all seem to struggle with the same
thing.

For me, the hard part of a Java IDE or language server was never the code intelligence. It was getting
the project structure right. The IDE reads your build files and then tries to guess the module
structure from them. And over time, Java's compiler and runtime configuration has become more and more
complex: annotation processors, the module system, and more. So you often end up in a familiar place:
the code compiles and runs in the build, but not in the IDE. Even the best ones tend to break the
project setup after an upgrade.

## The problem I kept hitting

So it was no surprise that when I wanted to try a different editor for my Java projects, I couldn't get
any of the existing language servers to work. Something always broke, and I could not figure out why.
Most likely it was because my projects use a lot of annotation processing and Java modules (JPMS).

That got me thinking: how hard would it be to build my own language server, just to solve this for me
and my colleagues, and get a real Java IDE experience in our favorite editor? This is possible thanks to
the Language Server Protocol (LSP), a standard that lets one server bring the same features to any
editor. Not long ago this would have been too much for a single developer. AI coding agents are what
made it possible.

## The idea

The tool I built is called Lathe — a Java LSP — and the idea behind it is simple: instead of guessing the project
setup, capture it from the build.

We use Maven, and Maven lets you register a build extension that wraps the compiler and test harness. Lathe uses this to
record everything the editor needs — classpath, module path, annotation processing, and test
configuration — right from the build, exactly as Maven sees it. This is the *capture* part.

The language server then reads this captured information, and refreshes it every time you run a build.
Runs, tests, and debugging are *replayed* from what was captured, without a new Maven build. This also
feels natural: to update the editor, you just run a build, which you already do anyway.

So, in short: if your Maven build works, Lathe works too.

## What it actually does

Lathe is a standard language server, so it works in any editor that speaks LSP. I use it in Neovim,
which has a dedicated client that also adds run, test, and debug. It works in Emacs too, through the
built-in Eglot, with no extra plugin. A VS Code client is planned.

Because everything comes from the real build, the features just reflect what the compiler already knows.
Here is the full list, grouped:

- **Code intelligence** — completion with automatic imports; go to definition and declaration (into your
  own code, your dependencies, and the JDK sources); find references; call hierarchy; type hierarchy;
  implementations and subtypes; document and workspace symbol search with CamelCase matching (`ASF`
  finds `AbstractServerFactory`); signature help; hover with Javadoc; document highlight; code folding;
  and semantic highlighting.
- **Diagnostics and refactoring** — the exact `javac` errors and warnings for your build, plus warnings
  for unused private members and locals; quick fixes and refactorings (add missing imports, add
  `throws`, wrap in `try/catch`, extract variable, constant, or field, and more); and optional
  google-java-format.
- **Run, test, and debug** — run a `main`, run tests (a single method, a class, or a package), and full
  debugging with breakpoints, stepping, variable inspection, and expression evaluation. Everything is
  replayed from the build, without a fresh Maven run.
- **Scaffolding** — create a new class, interface, record, enum, annotation, or test, placed in the
  right module and package for you.

## Getting started

You need Java 21+ (the same JDK your build uses) and Maven 3.x. Setup is three steps, and you only do it
once.

First, register the Lathe extension at your project root — either in `.mvn/extensions.xml` or in your
root `pom.xml` under `<build><extensions>`:

```xml
<extension>
    <groupId>io.github.ag-libs</groupId>
    <artifactId>lathe-maven-extension</artifactId>
    <version>...</version> <!-- latest version from Maven Central -->
</extension>
```

You can find the latest version on
[Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.github.ag-libs/lathe-maven-extension).

Then run a build once to capture everything, and add `.lathe/` to your `.gitignore`:

```bash
mvn clean test -Dlathe.capture.only=true
```

Finally, set up your editor. For Neovim, point your plugin manager at the client the build unpacks into
`~/.cache/lathe/current/neovim`. For Emacs, no plugin is needed — one line in `init.el` points the
built-in Eglot at Lathe's launcher.

After that it keeps itself in sync: every build refreshes the configuration, and Lathe also notices when
files change outside the editor, such as after a `git pull`. The full setup, with editor config, is in
the README.

## Where it is now

Lathe is open source under the Apache 2.0 license. It is still early — I built it to solve my own
problem, and it now does that well for me and my colleagues, on real modular projects that use
annotation processing. The Neovim client is the most complete one; Emacs works through Eglot; a VS Code
client is next.

If this sounds like a problem you have too, I would really like to know whether it helps you. The code,
the full setup, and a short demo are on [GitHub](https://github.com/ag-libs/lathe), and the artifacts
are on [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.github.ag-libs/lathe-maven-extension).
